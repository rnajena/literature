  abstract        = {We describe the development and evaluation of a novel method for targeted amplification and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based identification of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) agents and assess the feasibility of this approach in diagnostics. An ultrahigh-multiplex panel was designed with primers to amplify all known variants of VHF-associated viruses and relevant controls. The performance of the panel was evaluated via serially quantified nucleic acids from Yellow fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, Ebola virus, Junin virus and Chikungunya virus in a semiconductor-based sequencing platform. A comparison of direct NGS and targeted amplification-NGS was performed. The panel was further tested via a real-time nanopore sequencing-based platform, using clinical specimens from CCHF patients. The multiplex primer panel comprises two pools of 285 and 256 primer pairs for the identification of 46 virus species causing hemorrhagic fevers, encompassing 6,130 genetic variants of the strains involved. In silico validation revealed that the panel detected over 97% of all known genetic variants of the targeted virus species. High levels of specificity and sensitivity were observed for the tested virus strains. Targeted amplification ensured viral read detection in specimens with the lowest virus concentration (1-10 genome equivalents) and enabled significant increases in specific reads over background for all viruses investigated. In clinical specimens, the panel enabled detection of the causative agent and its characterization within 10 minutes of sequencing, with sample-to-result time of less than 3.5 hours. Virus enrichment via targeted amplification followed by NGS is an applicable strategy for the diagnosis of VHFs which can be adapted for high-throughput or nanopore sequencing platforms and employed for surveillance or outbreak monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Virulence determines the impact a pathogen has on the fitness of its host, yet current understanding of the evolutionary origins and causes of virulence of many pathogens is surprisingly incomplete. Here, we explore the evolution of Marek's disease virus (MDV), a herpesvirus commonly afflicting chickens and rarely other avian species. The history of MDV in the 20th century represents an important case study in the evolution of virulence. The severity of MDV infection in chickens has been rising steadily since the adoption of intensive farming techniques and vaccination programs in the 1950s and 1970s, respectively. It has remained uncertain, however, which of these factors is causally more responsible for the observed increase in virulence of circulating viruses. We conducted a phylogenomic study to understand the evolution of MDV in the context of dramatic changes to poultry farming and disease control. Our analysis reveals evidence of geographical structuring of MDV strains, with reconstructions supporting the emergence of virulent viruses independently in North America and Eurasia. Of note, the emergence of virulent viruses appears to coincide approximately with the introduction of comprehensive vaccination on both continents. The time-dated phylogeny also indicated that MDV has a mean evolutionary rate of ~1.6 × 10  substitutions per site per year. An examination of gene-linked mutations did not identify a strong association between mutational variation and virulence phenotypes, indicating that MDV may evolve readily and rapidly under strong selective pressures and that multiple genotypic pathways may underlie virulence adaptation in MDV.},

Mononegaviruses have non-segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA genomes that are encapsidated by nucleoprotein and other viral proteins to form a helical nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid acts as a scaffold for virus assembly and as a template for genome transcription and replication. Insights into nucleoprotein-nucleoprotein interactions have been derived from structural studies of oligomerized, RNA-encapsidating nucleoprotein, and cryo-electron microscopy of nucleocapsid or nucleocapsid-like structures. There have been no high-resolution reconstructions of complete mononegavirus nucleocapsids. Here we apply cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the structure of Ebola virus nucleocapsid within intact viruses and recombinant nucleocapsid-like assemblies. These structures reveal the identity and arrangement of the nucleocapsid components, and suggest that the formation of an extended α-helix from the disordered carboxy-terminal region of nucleoprotein-core links nucleoprotein oligomerization, nucleocapsid condensation, RNA encapsidation, and accessory protein recruitment.},

Cowpox viruses are zoonotic poxviruses with an extraordinarily broad host range, demonstrating their adaptive potential in vivo. To elucidate adaptation mechanisms of poxviruses, we isolated cowpox virus particles from a rat and passaged them five times in a human and a rat cell line. Subsequently, we analyzed the proteome and genome of the non-passaged virions and each passage. While the overall viral genome sequence was stable during passaging, proteomics revealed multiple changes in the virion composition. Interestingly, an increased viral fitness in human cells was observed in the presence of increased immunomodulatory protein amounts. As the only minor variant with increasing frequency during passaging was located in a viral RNA polymerase subunit and, moreover, most minor variants were found in transcription-associated genes, protein amounts were presumably regulated at transcription level. This study is the first comparative proteome analysis of virus particles before and after cell culture propagation, revealing proteomic changes as a novel poxvirus adaptation mechanism.},

Here we identify several acetylation sites of the influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP), including the lysine residues K77, K113 and K229. Viral growth of mutant virus encoding K229R, mimicking a non-acetylated NP lysine residue, is severely impaired compared to wildtype or the mutant viruses encoding K77R or K113R. This attenuation is not the result of decreased polymerase activity, altered protein expression or disordered vRNP co-segregation but rather caused by impaired particle release. Interestingly, release deficiency is also observed mimicking constant acetylation at this site (K229Q), whereas virus encoding NP-K113Q could not be generated. However, mimicking NP hyper-acetylation at K77 and K229 severely diminishes viral polymerase activity, while mimicking NP hypo-acetylation at these sites has no effect on viral replication. These results suggest that NP acetylation at K77, K113 and K229 impacts multiple steps in viral replication of influenza A viruses.},

Herpesviruses have evolved multiple ways to adapt the infected cells to their needs, but knowledge about these transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications is sparse. Here, we show that HSV-1 induces the expression of about 1000 antisense transcripts from the human host cell genome. A subset of these is also activated by the closely related varicella zoster virus. Antisense transcripts originate either at gene promoters or within the gene body, and they show different susceptibility to the inhibition of early and immediate early viral gene expression. Overexpression of the major viral transcription factor ICP4 is sufficient to turn on a subset of antisense transcripts. Histone marks around transcription start sites of HSV-1-induced and constitutively transcribed antisense transcripts are highly similar, indicating that the genetic loci are already poised to transcribe these novel RNAs. Furthermore, an antisense transcript overlapping with the BBC3 gene (also known as PUMA) transcriptionally silences this potent inducer of apoptosis in cis. We show for the first time that a virus induces widespread antisense transcription of the host cell genome. We provide evidence that HSV-1 uses this to downregulate a strong inducer of apoptosis. Our findings open new perspectives on global and specific alterations of host cell transcription by viruses.},

Due to the high mutation rate of HIV-1, resistance testing of the patient's viral strains to the bNAbs is still inevitable. So far, bNAb resistance can only be tested in expensive and time-consuming neutralization experiments. Here, we introduce well-performing computational models that predict the neutralization response of HIV-1 to bNAbs given only the envelope sequence of the virus. Using non-linear support vector machines based on a string kernel, the models learnt even the important binding sites of bNAbs with more complex epitopes, i.e., the CD4 binding site targeting bNAbs, proving thereby the biological relevance of the models. To increase the interpretability of the models, we additionally provide a new kind of motif logo for each query sequence, visualizing those residues of the test sequence that influenced the prediction outcome the most. Moreover, we predicted the neutralization sensitivity of around 34,000 HIV-1 samples from different time points to a broad range of bNAbs, enabling the first analysis of HIV resistance to bNAbs on a global scale. The analysis showed for many of the bNAbs a trend towards antibody resistance over time, which had previously only been discovered for a small non-representative subset of the global HIV-1 population.},

Lin et al. (2015,  , 89/7: 3512-22) recently investigated the evolutionary history of hepatitis B virus in a transmission chain and postulated that the 'colonization-adaptation-transmission' model can explain the differential impact of transmission on synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates. Here, we revisit this dataset using a full probabilistic Bayesian phylogenetic framework that adequately accounts for the non-independence of sequence data when estimating evolutionary parameters. Examination of the transmission chain data under a flexible coalescent prior reveals a general inconsistency between the estimated timings and clustering patterns and the known transmission history, highlighting the need to incorporate host transmission information in the analysis. Using an explicit genealogical transmission chain model, we find strong support for a transmission-associated decrease of the overall evolutionary rate. However, in contrast to the initially reported larger transmission effect on non-synonymous substitution rate, we find a similar decrease in both non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates that cannot be adequately explained by the colonization-adaptation-transmission model. An alternative explanation may involve a transmission/establishment advantage of hepatitis B virus variants that have accumulated fewer within-host substitutions, perhaps by spending more time in the covalently closed circular DNA state between each round of viral replication. More generally, this study illustrates that ignoring phylogenetic relationships can lead to misleading evolutionary estimates.},

However, a general overview over the structural repertoire of ambisense intergenic regions is currently lacking. In this study we investigated the structural potential of the intergenic regions of all known ambisense viruses and compared their structural repertoire by structure-guided clustering. Intergenic regions of most ambisense viruses possess a high potential to build stable secondary structures and many viruses share common structural motifs in the intergenic regions of their ambisense segments. We demonstrate that (i) within the phylogenetic virus groups sets of conserved functional structures are present, but that (ii) between the groups conservation is low to non-existent. These results reflect a high degree of freedom to regulate ambisense transcription termination and also imply that the genetic strategy of having an ambisense RNA genome has evolved several times independently.},

Data indicate that the number of first-time asylum applications by non-EU members increased from 290 000 in 2011 to more than 1·3 million in 2015. During the peak period of migration, The Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis was adopted by WHO. Viral hepatitis, and particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV), is an important disease because of its high prevalence and associated mortality. In some cases, HBV can be carried by refugees arriving from regions of high and intermediate prevalence. Refugees with HBV might not show clinical symptoms and not be diagnosed in destination countries with a low prevalence, where screening is not regularly done. Although transmission to the host population is low, dedicated surveillance and tailored public health policies are required. It is important to note that some of the countries that receive many migrants do not have a universal HBV vaccination programme. In this Viewpoint, we argue that the current large-scale movement from regions with high or intermediate HBV prevalence should be taken as an opportunity to achieve viral hepatitis elimination targets, by establishing a well prepared infrastructure for HBV screening, vaccination, and treatment.},

The question then arises whether a similar mechanism operates for filoviruses that also contain bipartite promoters that are governed by the "rule of six," even though these genomes need not, and given Ebola virus biology, cannot always be of hexamer genome length. This review suggests that this is possible and describes how it might operate, and that RNA editing may play a role in Ebola virus genome interconversion that helps the virus adapt to different host environments.},

Given the quasispecies (mutant cloud) nature of RNA viruses and many DNA viruses, the multiple genomes provide different starting points in sequence space to initiate adaptive walks. Moreover, en bloc transmission has implications for modulation of viral fitness and for the response of viral populations to lethal mutagenesis. Mechanisms that can enable multiple viral genomes to be transported en bloc among hosts has only recently been gaining attention. A growing body of research suggests that extracellular vesicles (EV) are highly prevalent and robust vehicles for en bloc delivery of viral particles and naked infectious genomes among organisms. Both RNA and DNA viruses exploit these vesicles to increase multiplicity of infection and enhance virulence.},

  abstract      = {Viral ecology of terrestrial habitats is yet-to be extensively explored, in particular the terrestrial subsurface. One problem in obtaining viral sequences from groundwater aquifer samples is the relatively low amount of virus particles. As a result, the amount of extracted DNA may not be sufficient for direct sequencing of such samples. Here we compared three DNA amplification methods to enrich viral DNA from three pristine limestone aquifer assemblages of the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory to evaluate potential bias created by the different amplification methods as determined by viral metagenomics. Linker amplification shotgun libraries resulted in lowest redundancy among the sequencing reads and showed the highest diversity, while multiple displacement amplification produced the highest number of contigs with the longest average contig size, suggesting a combination of these two methods is suitable for the successful enrichment of viral DNA from pristine groundwater samples. In total, we identified 27,173, 5,886 and 32,613 viral contigs from the three samples from which 11.92 to 18.65% could be assigned to taxonomy using blast. Among these, members of the   order were the most abundant group (52.20 to 69.12%) dominated by   and  . Those, and the high number of unknown viral sequences, substantially expand the known virosphere.},

  abstract     = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod borne emerging pathogen causing febrile illness. ZIKV is associated Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome and other neurological complications. Infection during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy complications and developmental and neurological abnormalities collectively defined as congenital Zika syndrome. There is still no vaccine or specific treatment for ZIKV infection. To identify host factors that can rescue cells from ZIKV infection we used a genome scale CRISPR activation screen. Our highly ranking hits included a short list of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) previously reported to have antiviral activity. Validation of the screen results highlighted IFNL2 and IFI6 as genes providing high levels of protection from ZIKV. Activation of these genes had an effect on an early stage in viral infection. In addition, infected cells expressing sgRNAs for both of these genes displayed lower levels of cell death compared to controls. Furthermore, the identified genes were significantly induced in ZIKV infected placenta explants. Thus, these results highlight a set of ISGs directly relevant for rescuing cells from ZIKV infection or its associated cell death and substantiates CRISPR activation screens as a tool to identify host factors impeding pathogen infection.IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging vector-borne pathogen causing a febrile disease. ZIKV infection might also trigger Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis. Vertical transmission of ZIKV can cause fetus demise, still birth or severe congenital abnormalities and neurological complications. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment against ZIKV. We used a genome wide CRISPR activation screen, where genes are activated from their native promoters to identify host cell factors that protect cells from ZIKV infection or associated cell death. The results provide better understanding of key host factors that protect cells from ZIKV infection and might assist in identifying novel antiviral targets.},

In contrast to Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing (NGS) can detect resistance mutations in minority populations. Thus, genotypic resistance testing based on NGS data can offer novel, treatment-relevant insights. Since existing web services for analyzing resistance in NGS samples are subject to long processing times and follow strictly rules-based approaches, we developed geno2pheno[ngs-freq], a web service for rapidly identifying drug resistance in HIV-1 and HCV samples. By relying on frequency files that provide the read counts of nucleotides or codons along a viral genome, the time-intensive step of processing raw NGS data is eliminated. Once a frequency file has been uploaded, consensus sequences are generated for a set of user-defined prevalence cutoffs, such that the constructed sequences contain only those nucleotides whose codon prevalence exceeds a given cutoff. After locally aligning the sequences to a set of references, resistance is predicted using the well-established approaches of geno2pheno[resistance] and geno2pheno[hcv]. geno2pheno[ngs-freq] can assist clinical decision making by enabling users to explore resistance in viral populations with different abundances and is freely available at http://ngs.geno2pheno.org.},

We assessed whether average pairwise diversity (APD) calculated using NGS sequences provided a more exact prediction of TSI and classification of infection recency (<1 year post-infection) compared to FAN. NGS-derived APD classifies an infection as recent with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 85%. When considering only the 207 samples for which FAN were available, NGS-derived APD exhibited a higher sensitivity (90% vs 78%) and specificity (95% vs 67%) than FAN.

An artificial, simulated   dataset of Illumina HiSeq sequences was provided to 13 different European institutes for bioinformatics analysis towards the identification of viral pathogens in high-throughput sequence data. Comparison of the participants' analyses shows that the use of different tools, programs, and databases for bioinformatics analyses can impact the correct identification of viral sequences from a simple dataset. The identification of slightly mutated and highly divergent virus genomes has been identified as being most challenging: Furthermore, the interpretation of the results together with a fictitious case report by the participants showed that in addition to the bioinformatics analysis, the virological evaluation of the results can be important in clinical settings.External quality assessment and proficiency testing should become an important part of validating high-throughput sequencing-based virus diagnostics and could improve harmonization, comparability, and reproducibility of results.

Perhaps, however, it is genome sequencing that impacts a virologist the most. In 2017, more than 480 complete genome sequences of poxviruses have been generated, and are constantly used in many different ways by almost all molecular virologists. Matching this growth in data acquisition is an explosion of the relatively new field of bioinformatics, providing databases to store and organize this valuable/expensive data and algorithms to analyze it. For the bench virologist, access to intuitive, easy-to-use, software is often critical for performing bioinformatics-based experiments. Three common hurdles for the researcher are (1) selection, retrieval, and reformatting genomics data from large databases; (2) use of tools to compare/analyze the genomics data; and (3) display and interpretation of complex sets of results. This chapter is directed at the bench virologist and describes the software that helps overcome these obstacles, with a focus on the comparison and analysis of poxvirus genomes. Although poxvirus genomes are stored in public databases such as GenBank, this resource can be cumbersome and tedious to use if large amounts of data must to be collected. Therefore, we also highlight our Viral Orthologous Clusters database system and integrated tools that we developed specifically for the management and analysis of complete viral genomes.},

  year          = {2019},
  abstract      = {Different theories concerning the origin of RNA (and, in particular, mRNA) point to the concatenation and expansion of proto-tRNA-like structures. Different biochemical and biophysical tools have been used to search for ancient-like RNA elements with a specific structure in genomic viral RNAs, including that of the hepatitis C virus, as well as in cellular mRNA populations, in particular those of human hepatocytes. We define this method as "archaeological," and it has been designed to discover evolutionary patterns through a nonphylogenetic and nonrepresentational strategy. tRNA-like elements were found in structurally or functionally relevant positions both in viral RNA and in one of the liver mRNAs examined, the antagonist interferon-alpha subtype 5 (IFNA5) mRNA. Additionally, tRNA-like elements are highly represented within the hepatic mRNA population, which suggests that they could have participated in the formation of coding RNAs in the distant past. Expanding on this finding, we have observed a recurring dsRNA-like motif next to the tRNA-like elements in both viral RNAs and IFNA5 mRNA. This suggested that the concatenation of these RNA motifs was an activity present in the RNA pools that might have been relevant in the RNA world. The extensive alteration of sequences that likely triggered the transition from the predecessors of coding RNAs to the first fully functional mRNAs (which was not the case in the stepwise construction of noncoding rRNAs) hinders the phylogeny-based identification of RNA elements (both sequences and structures) that might have been active before the advent of protein synthesis. Therefore, our RNA archaeological method is presented as a way to better understand the structural/functional versatility of a variety of RNA elements, which might represent "the losers" in the process of RNA evolution as they had to adapt to the selective pressures favoring the coding capacity of the progressively longer mRNAs.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has highlighted the important role of intercellular heterogeneity in phenotype variability in both health and disease . However, current scRNA-seq approaches provide only a snapshot of gene expression and convey little information on the true temporal dynamics and stochastic nature of transcription. A further key limitation of scRNA-seq analysis is that the RNA profile of each individual cell can be analysed only once. Here we introduce single-cell, thiol-(SH)-linked alkylation of RNA for metabolic labelling sequencing (scSLAM-seq), which integrates metabolic RNA labelling , biochemical nucleoside conversion  and scRNA-seq to record transcriptional activity directly by differentiating between new and old RNA for thousands of genes per single cell. We use scSLAM-seq to study the onset of infection with lytic cytomegalovirus in single mouse fibroblasts. The cell-cycle state and dose of infection deduced from old RNA enable dose-response analysis based on new RNA. scSLAM-seq thereby both visualizes and explains differences in transcriptional activity at the single-cell level. Furthermore, it depicts 'on-off' switches and transcriptional burst kinetics in host gene expression with extensive gene-specific differences that correlate with promoter-intrinsic features (TBP-TATA-box interactions and DNA methylation). Thus, gene-specific, and not cell-specific, features explain the heterogeneity in transcriptomes between individual cells and the transcriptional response to perturbations.},

RSV epidemiological data alone has been insufficient in defining who acquires infection from whom (WAIFW) within households. We investigated RSV genomic variation within and between infected individuals and assessed its potential utility in tracking transmission in households. Over an entire single RSV season in coastal Kenya, nasal swabs were collected from members of 20 households every 3-4 days regardless of symptom status and screened for RSV nucleic acid. Next generation sequencing was used to generate >90% RSV full-length genomes for 51.1% of positive samples (191/374). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) observed during household infection outbreaks ranged from 0-21 (median: 3) while SNPs observed during single-host infection episodes ranged from 0-17 (median: 1). Using the viral genomic data alone there was insufficient resolution to fully reconstruct within-household transmission chains. For households with clear index cases, the most likely source of infant infection was via a toddler (aged 1 to <3 years-old) or school-aged (aged 6 to <12 years-old) co-occupant. However, for best resolution of WAIFW within households, we suggest an integrated analysis of RSV genomic and epidemiological data.},

Moreover, recent developments in synthetic biology raise concerns that some strains of bacteria could be modified for malicious purposes. Traditional approaches to open-view pathogen detection depend on databases of known organisms, which limits their performance on unknown, unrecognized, and unmapped sequences. In contrast, machine learning methods can infer pathogenic phenotypes from single NGS reads, even though the biological context is unavailable. We present DeePaC, a Deep Learning Approach to Pathogenicity Classification. It includes a flexible framework allowing easy evaluation of neural architectures with reverse-complement parameter sharing. We show that convolutional neural networks and LSTMs outperform the state-of-the-art based on both sequence homology and machine learning. Combining a deep learning approach with integrating the predictions for both mates in a read pair results in cutting the error rate almost in half in comparison to the previous state-of-the-art.

  abstract        = {Efficient and reliable identification of emerging pathogens is crucial for the design and implementation of timely and proportionate control strategies. This is difficult if the pathogen is so far unknown or only distantly related with known pathogens. Diagnostic metagenomics - an undirected, broad and sensitive method for the efficient identification of pathogens - was frequently used for virus and bacteria detection, but seldom applied to parasite identification. Here, metagenomics datasets prepared from swine faeces using an unbiased sample processing approach with RNA serving as starting material were re-analysed with respect to parasite detection. The taxonomic identification tool RIEMS, used for initial detection, provided basic hints on potential pathogens contained in the datasets. The suspected parasites/intestinal protists (Blastocystis, Entamoeba, Iodamoeba, Neobalantidium, Tetratrichomonas) were verified using subsequently applied reference mapping analyses on the base of rRNA sequences. Nearly full-length gene sequences could be extracted from the RNA-derived datasets. In the case of Blastocystis, subtyping was possible with subtype (ST)15 discovered for the first known time in swine faeces. Using RIEMS, some of the suspected candidates turned out to be false-positives caused by the poor status of sequences in publicly available databases. Altogether, 11 different species/STs of parasites/intestinal protists were detected in 34 out of 41 datasets extracted from metagenomics data. The approach operates without any primer bias that typically hampers the analysis of amplicon-based approaches, and allows the detection and taxonomic classification including subtyping of protist and metazoan endobionts (parasites, commensals or mutualists) based on an abundant biomarker, the 18S rRNA. The generic nature of the approach also allows evaluation of interdependencies that induce mutualistic or pathogenic effects that are often not clear for many intestinal protists and perhaps other parasites. Thus, metagenomics has the potential for generic pathogen identification beyond the characterization of viruses and bacteria when starting from RNA instead of DNA.},

One important facet of this discovery is identification of the hosts of these recently characterized uncultured viruses. To this end, we have adapted the viral tagging approach, which bypasses the need for culture-based methods to identify host-phage pairings. Fluorescently labelled anonymous virions adsorb to unlabelled anonymous bacterial host cells, which are then individually sorted as host-phage pairs, followed by genome amplification and high-throughput sequencing to establish the identities of both the host and the attached virus(es). We demonstrate single-cell viral tagging using the faecal microbiome, including cross-tagging of viruses and bacteria between human subjects. A total of 363 unique host-phage pairings were predicted, most of which were subject-specific and involved previously uncharacterized viruses despite the majority of their bacterial hosts having known taxonomy. One-fifth of these pairs were confirmed by multiple individual tagged cells. Viruses targeting more than one bacterial species were conspicuously absent in the host-phage network, suggesting that phages are not major vectors of inter-species horizontal gene transfer in the human gut. A high level of cross-reactivity between phages and bacteria from different subjects was noted despite subject-specific viral profiles, which has implications for faecal microbiota transplant therapy.},

A prominent example for these infections is rubella virus (RV) which most commonly leads to defects in ear, heart, and eye development. We applied teratogenic RV to human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) followed by differentiation into cells of the three embryonic lineages (ecto-, meso-, and endoderm) as a cell culture model for blastocyst- and gastrulation-like stages. In the presence of RV, lineage-specific differentiation markers were expressed, indicating that lineage identity was maintained. However, portrait analysis of the transcriptomic expression signatures of all samples revealed that mock- and RV-infected endodermal cells were less related to each other than their ecto- and mesodermal counterparts. Markers for definitive endoderm were increased during RV infection. Profound alterations of the epigenetic landscape including the expression level of components of the chromatin remodeling complexes and an induction of type III interferons were found, especially after endodermal differentiation of RV-infected iPSCs. Moreover, the eye field transcription factors RAX and SIX3 and components of the gene set vasculogenesis were identified as dysregulated transcripts. Although iPSC morphology was maintained, the formation of embryoid bodies as three-dimensional cell aggregates and as such cellular adhesion capacity was impaired during RV infection. The correlation of the molecular alterations induced by RV during differentiation of iPSCs with the clinical signs of congenital rubella syndrome suggests mechanisms of viral impairment of human development.},

  abstract        = {Primary human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures represent a universal platform to propagate respiratory viruses and characterize their host interactions in authentic target cells. To further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors in the airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification. However, the short and finite lifespan of primary cells in cell culture creates a bottleneck for the genetic modification of these cultures. In the current study, we show that the incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) during cell propagation extends the life span of primary human cells in vitro and thereby facilitates the incorporation of lentivirus-based expression systems. Using fluorescent reporters for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based sorting, we generated homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation via inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, functional characterization of these transgenic hAEC cultures with exogenous poly (I:C), as a proxy for virus infection, demonstrates that such modifications do not influence the host innate immune response. Moreover, the propagation kinetics of both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) were not affected. Combined, these results validate our newly established protocol for the genetic modification of hAEC cultures, thereby unlocking a unique potential for detailed molecular characterization of virus-host interactions in human respiratory epithelium.},

  abstract        = {Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging owing to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called "quasispecies." Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (1) RNA virus genomes and (2) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs composed of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. By using DRS, we were able to map the longest (∼26-kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, by using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by showing the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that DRS may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.},

Here, we develop a novel screening approach that enables a rapid functional identification of antiviral esiRNAs. Tests on the efficacy of such identified esiRNAs of a model virus achieved a virtual full protection of plants against a massive subsequent infection in transient applications. We find that the functionality of esiRNAs depends crucially on two properties: the binding affinity to Argonaute proteins and the ability to access the target RNA. The ability to rapidly identify functional esiRNAs could be of great benefit for all RNA silencing-based plant protection measures against viruses and other pathogens.},

Advances in high-throughput sequencing, including portable genomic sequencing at reduced costs and turnaround time, are paralleled by continuing developments in methodology to infer evolutionary histories (dynamics/patterns) and to identify factors driving viral spread in space and time. The traditionally static nature of visualizing phylogenetic trees that represent these evolutionary relationships/processes has also evolved, albeit perhaps at a slower rate. Advanced visualization tools with increased resolution assist in drawing conclusions from phylogenetic estimates and may even have potential to better inform public health and treatment decisions, but the design (and choice of what analyses are shown) is hindered by the complexity of information embedded within current phylogenetic models and the integration of available meta-data.

  abstract        = {Mosquitoes are the most important invertebrate viral vectors in humans and harbor a high diversity of understudied viruses, which has been shown in many mosquito virome studies in recent years. These studies generally performed metagenomics sequencing on pools of mosquitoes, without assessment of the viral diversity in individual mosquitoes. To address this issue, we applied our optimized viral metagenomics protocol (NetoVIR) to compare the virome of single and pooled Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected from different locations in Guadeloupe, in 2016 and 2017. The total read number and viral reads proportion of samples containing a single mosquito have no significant difference compared with those of pools containing five mosquitoes, which proved the feasibility of using single mosquito for viral metagenomics. A comparative analysis of the virome revealed a higher abundance and more diverse eukaryotic virome in Aedes aegypti, whereas Culex quinquefasciatus harbors a richer and more diverse phageome. The majority of the identified eukaryotic viruses were mosquito-species specific. We further characterized the genomes of 11 novel eukaryotic viruses. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analyses of the six most abundant eukaryotic viruses indicated that the majority of individual mosquitoes were infected by several of the selected viruses with viral genome copies per mosquito ranging from 267 to 1.01 × 10  (median 7.5 × 10 ) for Ae. aegypti and 192 to 8.69 × 10  (median 4.87 × 10 ) for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Additionally, in Cx. quinquefasciatus, a number of phage contigs co-occurred with several marker genes of Wolbachia sp. strain wPip. We firstly demonstrate the feasibility to use single mosquito for viral metagenomics, which can provide much more precise virome profiles of mosquito populations. Interspecific comparisons show striking differences in abundance and diversity between the viromes of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Those two mosquito species seem to have their own relatively stable "core eukaryotic virome", which might have important implications for the competence to transmit important medically relevant arboviruses. The presence of Wolbachia in Cx. quinquefasciatus might explain (1) the lower overall viral load compared to Ae. aegypti, (2) the identification of multiple unknown phage contigs, and (3) the difference in competence for important human pathogens. How these viruses, phages, and bacteria influence the physiology and vector competence of mosquito hosts warrants further research.},

  abstract        = {Shotgun metagenomics using next generation sequencing (NGS) is a promising technique to analyze both DNA and RNA microbial material from patient samples. Mostly used in a research setting, it is now increasingly being used in the clinical realm as well, notably to support diagnosis of viral infections, thereby calling for quality control and the implementation of ring trials (RT) to benchmark pipelines and ensure comparable results. The Swiss NGS clinical virology community therefore decided to conduct a RT in 2018, in order to benchmark current metagenomic workflows used at Swiss clinical virology laboratories, and thereby contribute to the definition of common best practices. The RT consisted of two parts (increments), in order to disentangle the variability arising from the experimental compared to the bioinformatics parts of the laboratory pipeline. In addition, the RT was also designed to assess the impact of databases compared to bioinformatics algorithms on the final results, by asking participants to perform the bioinformatics analysis with a common database, in addition to using their own in-house database. Five laboratories participated in the RT (seven pipelines were tested). We observed that the algorithms had a stronger impact on the overall performance than the choice of the reference database. Our results also suggest that differences in sample preparation can lead to significant differences in the performance, and that laboratories should aim for at least 5-10 Mio reads per sample and use depth of coverage in addition to other interpretation metrics such as the percent of coverage. Performance was generally lower when increasing the number of viruses per sample. The lessons learned from this pilot study will be useful for the development of larger-scale RTs to serve as regular quality control tests for laboratories performing NGS analyses of viruses in a clinical setting.},

Cellular and anatomical sources responsible for reinitiating viral replication remain a subject of ardent debate, despite extensive research efforts. To unravel the source of rebounding viruses, we conducted a large-scale HIV-STAR (HIV-1 sequencing before analytical treatment interruption to identify the anatomically relevant HIV reservoir) clinical trial. We collected samples from 11 participants and compared the genetic composition of (pro)viruses collected under treatment from different cellular and anatomical compartments with that of plasma viruses sampled during analytical treatment interruption. We found a remarkably heterogeneous source of viral rebound. In addition, irrespective of the compartment or cell subset, genetically identical viral expansions played a significant role in viral rebound. Our study suggests that although there does not seem to be a primary source for rebound HIV, cellular proliferation is an important driver of HIV persistence and should therefore be considered in future curative strategies.},

Viral metagenomics was recently applied to a wide variety of environmental samples and standardized procedures for recovering viral particles from different type of materials has emerged. In this study, we adapted a procedure originally developed to extract viruses from fecal samples, in order to enable efficient virome analysis of cheese surface. We tested and validated the positive impact of both addition of a filtration step prior to virus concentration and substitution of purification by density gradient ultracentrifugation by a simple chloroform treatment to eliminate membrane vesicles. Viral DNA extracted from the several procedures, as well as a vesicle sample, were sequenced using Illumina paired-end MiSeq technology and the subsequent clusters assembled from the virome were analyzed to assess those belonging to putative phages, plasmid-derived DNA, or even from bacterial chromosomal DNA. The best procedure was then chosen, and used to describe the first cheese surface virome, using Epoisses cheese as example. This study provides the basis of future investigations regarding the ecological importance of viruses in cheese microbial ecosystems.},

Its dsDNA genome (170-194 kbp) is scattered with homopolymers and repeats as well as inverted-terminal-repeats (ITR), which hamper whole-genome sequencing. To date, only a few genome sequences have been published and only for some are data on sequence quality available enabling in-depth investigations. Especially in Europe and Asia, where ASFV has continuously spread since its introduction into Georgia in 2007, a very low genetic variability of the circulating ASFV-strains was reported. Therefore, only whole-genome sequences can serve as a basis for detailed virus comparisons. Here, we report an effective workflow, combining target enrichment, Illumina and Nanopore sequencing for ASFV whole-genome sequencing. Following this approach, we generated an improved high-quality ASFV Georgia 2007/1 whole-genome sequence leading to the correction of 71 sequencing errors and the addition of 956 and 231 bp at the respective ITRs. This genome, derived from the primary outbreak in 2007, can now serve as a reference for future whole-genome analyses of related ASFV strains and molecular approaches. Using both workflow and the reference genome, we generated the first ASFV-whole-genome sequence from Moldova, expanding the sequence knowledge from Eastern Europe.},

However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample  -mers (twenty-two nucleotide sequences) to  -mers from taxonomically labeled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for eighty-nine clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method. DisCVR detected human viruses with high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (100%), and was able to detect mixed infections. Moreover, it produced results comparable to those in a published metagenomic analysis of 177 blood samples from patients in Nigeria. DisCVR has been designed as a user-friendly tool for detecting human viruses from HTS data using computers with limited RAM and processing power, and includes a graphical user interface to help users interpret and validate the output. It is written in Java and is publicly available from http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/discvr.php.},

Spatially explicit reconstructions of viral spread represent valuable sources of lineage movement data that can be exploited to investigate the impact of underlying environmental layers on the dispersal of pathogens. Here, we performed phylogeographic inference and applied different post hoc approaches to analyse a new and comprehensive data set of viral genomes to elucidate the dispersal history and dynamics of rabies virus (RABV) in Iran, which have remained largely unknown. We first analysed the association between environmental factors and variations in dispersal velocity among lineages. Second, we present, test and apply a new approach to study the link between environmental conditions and the dispersal direction of lineages. The statistical performance (power of detection, false-positive rate) of this new method was assessed using simulations. We performed phylogeographic analyses of RABV genomes, allowing us to describe the large diversity of RABV in Iran and to confirm the cocirculation of several clades in the country. Overall, we estimate a relatively high lineage dispersal velocity, similar to previous estimates for dog rabies virus spread in northern Africa. Finally, we highlight a tendency for RABV lineages to spread in accessible areas associated with high human population density. Our analytical workflow illustrates how phylogeographic approaches can be used to investigate the impact of environmental factors on several aspects of viral dispersal dynamics.},

Improved surveillance and better understanding of risks require a better understanding of the circulating viral diversity in these biting insects. In this study, we expand the sequence space of RNA viruses by identifying a number of novel RNA viruses from   (biting midge) using a meta-transcriptomic approach. A novel metaviromic pipeline called MetaViC was developed specifically to identify novel virus sequence signatures from high throughput sequencing (HTS) datasets in the absence of a known host genome. MetaViC is a protein centric pipeline that looks for specific protein signatures in the reads and contigs generated as part of the pipeline. Several novel viruses, including an alphanodavirus with both segments, a novel relative of the Hubei sobemo-like virus 49, two rhabdo-like viruses and a chuvirus, were identified in the Scottish midge samples. The newly identified viruses were found to be phylogenetically distinct to those previous known. These findings expand our current knowledge of viral diversity in arthropods and especially in these understudied disease vectors.},
