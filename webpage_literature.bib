  abstract     = {The protein-coding sequences of messenger RNAs are the linear template for translation of the gene sequence into protein. Nevertheless, the RNA can also form secondary structures by intramolecular base-pairing. We show that the nucleotide distribution within codons is biased in all taxa of life on a global scale. Thereby, RNA secondary structures that require base-pairing between the position 1 of a codon with the position 1 of an opposing codon (here named RNA secondary structure class c1) are under-represented. We conclude that this bias may result from the co-evolution of codon sequence and mRNA secondary structure, suggesting that RNA secondary structures are generally important in protein coding regions of mRNAs. The above result also implies that codon position 2 has a smaller influence on the amino acid choice than codon position 1.},

  abstract        = {Establishment of multicellularity represents a major transition in eukaryote evolution. A subgroup of Amoebozoa, the dictyosteliids, has evolved a relatively simple aggregative multicellular stage resulting in a fruiting body supported by a stalk. Protosteloid amoeba, which are scattered throughout the amoebozoan tree, differ by producing only one or few single stalked spores. Thus, one obvious difference in the developmental cycle of protosteliids and dictyosteliids seems to be the establishment of multicellularity. To separate spore development from multicellular interactions, we compared the genome and transcriptome of a Protostelium species (Protostelium aurantium var. fungivorum) with those of social and solitary members of the Amoebozoa. During fruiting body formation nearly 4,000 genes, corresponding to specific pathways required for differentiation processes, are upregulated. A comparison with genes involved in the development of dictyosteliids revealed conservation of >500 genes, but most of them are also present in Acanthamoeba castellanii for which fruiting bodies have not been documented. Moreover, expression regulation of those genes differs between P. aurantium and Dictyostelium discoideum. Within Amoebozoa differentiation to fruiting bodies is common, but our current genome analysis suggests that protosteliids and dictyosteliids used different routes to achieve this. Most remarkable is both the large repertoire and diversity between species in genes that mediate environmental sensing and signal processing. This likely reflects an immense adaptability of the single cell stage to varying environmental conditions. We surmise that this signaling repertoire provided sufficient building blocks to accommodate the relatively simple demands for cell-cell communication in the early multicellular forms.},

  abstract     = {Only a minority of patients infected with seasonal influenza A viruses exhibit a severe or fatal outcome of infection, but the reasons for this inter-individual variability in influenza susceptibility are unclear. To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this variability, we investigated naturally occurring allelic variations of the myxovirus resistance 1 ( ) gene coding for the influenza restriction factor MxA. The interferon-induced dynamin-like GTPase consists of an N-terminal GTPase domain, a bundle signaling element, and a C-terminal stalk responsible for oligomerization and viral target recognition. We used online databases to search for variations in the   gene. Deploying   approaches, we found that non-synonymous variations in the GTPase domain cause the loss of antiviral and enzymatic activities. Furthermore, we showed that these amino acid substitutions disrupt the interface for GTPase domain dimerization required for the stimulation of GTP hydrolysis. Variations in the stalk were neutral or slightly enhanced or abolished MxA antiviral function. Remarkably, two other stalk variants altered MxA's antiviral specificity. Variations causing the loss of antiviral activity were found only in heterozygous carriers. Interestingly, the inactive stalk variants blocked the antiviral activity of WT MxA in a dominant-negative way, suggesting that heterozygotes are phenotypically MxA-negative. In contrast, the GTPase-deficient variants showed no dominant-negative effect, indicating that heterozygous carriers should remain unaffected. Our results demonstrate that naturally occurring mutations in the human   gene can influence MxA function, which may explain individual variations in influenza virus susceptibility in the human population.},

HCoV-229E SL1 and SL2 mutants generated by reverse genetics were used to study the effects on viral replication of single-nucleotide substitutions predicted to destabilize the SL1 and SL2 structures. The data provide conclusive evidence for the critical role of SL1 and SL2 in HCoV-229E replication and, in some cases, revealed parallels with previously characterized betacoronavirus SL1 and SL2 elements. Also, we were able to rescue viable HCoV-229E mutants carrying replacements of SL2 with equivalent betacoronavirus structural elements.

  abstract        = {Bats serve as a reservoir for various, often zoonotic viruses, including significant human pathogens such as Ebola and influenza viruses. However, for unknown reasons, viral infections rarely cause clinical symptoms in bats. A tight control of viral replication by the host innate immune defense might contribute to this phenomenon. Transcriptomic studies revealed the presence of the interferon-induced antiviral myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins in bats, but detailed functional aspects have not been assessed. To provide evidence that bat Mx proteins might act as key factors to control viral replication we cloned   cDNAs from three bat families, Pteropodidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae. Phylogenetically these bat   genes cluster closely with their human ortholog MxA. Using transfected cell cultures, minireplicon systems, virus-like particles, and virus infections, we determined the antiviral potential of the bat Mx1 proteins. Bat Mx1 significantly reduced the polymerase activity of viruses circulating in bats, including Ebola and influenza A-like viruses. The related Thogoto virus, however, which is not known to infect bats, was not inhibited by bat Mx1. Further, we provide evidence for positive selection in bat   genes that might explain species-specific antiviral activities of these proteins. Together, our data suggest a role for Mx1 in controlling these viruses in their bat hosts.  Bats are a natural reservoir for various viruses that rarely cause clinical symptoms in bats but are dangerous zoonotic pathogens, like Ebola or rabies virus. It has been hypothesized that the interferon system might play a key role in controlling viral replication in bats. We speculate that the interferon-induced Mx proteins might be key antiviral factors of bats and have coevolved with bat-borne viruses. This study evaluated for the first time a large set of bat Mx1 proteins spanning three major bat families for their antiviral potential, including activity against Ebola virus and bat influenza A-like virus, and we describe here their phylogenetic relationship, revealing patterns of positive selection that suggest a coevolution with viral pathogens. By understanding the molecular mechanisms of the innate resistance of bats against viral diseases, we might gain important insights into how to prevent and fight human zoonotic infections caused by bat-borne viruses.},

  abstract        = {Mycoses induced by C.albicans or A.fumigatus can cause important host damage either by deficient or exaggerated immune response. Regulation of chemokine and cytokine signaling plays a crucial role for an adequate inflammation, which can be modulated by vitamins A and D. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as transcription factors or cis-acting antisense RNAs are known to be involved in gene regulation. However, the processes during fungal infections and treatment with vitamins in terms of therapeutic impact are unknown. We show that in monocytes both vitamins regulate ncRNAs involved in amino acid metabolism and immune system processes using comprehensive RNA-Seq analyses. Compared to protein-coding genes, fungi and bacteria induced an expression change in relatively few ncRNAs, but with massive fold changes of up to 4000. We defined the landscape of long-ncRNAs (lncRNAs) in response to pathogens and observed variation in the isoforms composition for several lncRNA following infection and vitamin treatment. Most of the involved antisense RNAs are regulated and positively correlated with their sense protein-coding genes. We investigated lncRNAs with stimulus specific immunomodulatory activity as potential marker genes: LINC00595, SBF2-AS1 (A.fumigatus) and RP11-588G21.2, RP11-394l13.1 (C.albicans) might be detectable in the early phase of infection and serve as therapeutic targets in the future.},

  abstract        = {Vitamin A and vitamin D are essential nutrients with a wide range of pleiotropic effects in humans. Beyond their well-documented roles in cellular differentiation, embryogenesis, tissue maintenance and bone/calcium homeostasis, both vitamins have attracted considerable attention due to their association with-immunological traits. Nevertheless, our knowledge of their immunomodulatory potential during infection is restricted to single gene-centric studies, which do not reflect the complexity of immune processes. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive RNA-seq-based approach to define the whole immunomodulatory role of vitamins A and D during infection. Using human monocytes as host cells, we characterized the differential role of both vitamins upon infection with three different pathogens: Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Escherichia coli. Both vitamins showed an unexpected ability to counteract the pathogen-induced transcriptional responses. Upon infection, we identified 346 and 176 immune-relevant genes that were regulated by atRA and vitD, respectively. This immunomodulatory activity was dependent on the inflammatory stimulus, allowing us to distinguish regulatory patterns which were specific for each stimulatory setting. Moreover, we explored possible direct and indirect mechanisms of vitamin-mediated regulation of the immune response. Our findings highlight the importance of vitamin-monitoring in critically ill patients. Moreover, our results underpin the potential of atRA and vitD as therapeutic options for anti-inflammatory treatment.},

  abstract        = {Groundwater-associated microorganisms are known to play an important role in the biogeochemical C, N and S cycling. Metaproteomics was applied to characterize the diversity and the activity of microbes to identify key species in major biogeochemical processes in the anoxic groundwater of a pristine karstic aquifer located in Hainich, central Germany. Sampling was achieved by pumping 1000L water from two sites of the upper aquifer assemblage and filtration on 0.3μm glass filters. In total, 3808 protein groups were identified. Interestingly, the two wells (H4/2 and H5/2) differed not only in microbial density but also in the prevalence of different C, N and S cycling pathways. The well H5/2 was dominated by the anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing (anammox) candidate Brocadiales (31%) while other orders such as Burkholderiales (2%) or Nitrospirales (3%) were less abundant. Otherwise, the well H4/2 featured only low biomass and remarkably fewer proteins (391 to 3631 at H5/2). Candidate Brocadiales was affiliated to all major carbon fixation strategies, and to the cycling of N and S implying a major role in biogeochemical processes of groundwater aquifers. The findings of our study support functions which can be linked to the ecosystem services provided by the microbial communities present in aquifers. Subsurface environments especially the groundwater ecosystems represent a large habitat for microbial activity. Microbes are responsible for energy and nutrient cycling and are massively involved in the planet's sustainability. Microbial diversity is tremendous and the central question in current microbial ecology is "Who eats what, where and when?". In this study, we characterize a natural aquifer inhabiting microbial community to obtain evidence for the phylogenetic diversity and the metabolic activity by protein abundance and we highlight important biogeochemical cycling processes. The aquifer was dominated by Candidatus Brocadiales while other phylotypes such as Burkholderiales, Caulobacterales and Nitrospirales were less abundant. The candidate comprised all major carbon fixation strategies, ammonification, anammox and denitrification as well as assimilatory sulfate reduction. Our findings have broad implications for the understanding of microbial activities in this aquifer and consequently specific functions can be linked to the ecosystem services provided by the microbial communities present in aquifers.},

  abstract        = {We have analyzed the binding of the liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122) to three conserved target sites of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, two in the non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) coding region and one in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). miR-122 binding efficiency strongly depends on target site accessibility under conditions when the range of flanking sequences available for the formation of local RNA secondary structures changes. Our results indicate that the particular sequence feature that contributes most to the correlation between target site accessibility and binding strength varies between different target sites. This suggests that the dynamics of miRNA/Ago2 binding not only depends on the target site itself but also on flanking sequence context to a considerable extent, in particular in a small viral genome in which strong selection constraints act on coding sequence and overlapping cis-signals and model the accessibility of cis-signals. In full-length genomes, single and combination mutations in the miR-122 target sites reveal that site 5B.2 is positively involved in regulating overall genome replication efficiency, whereas mutation of site 5B.3 showed a weaker effect. Mutation of the 3'UTR site and double or triple mutants showed no significant overall effect on genome replication, whereas in a translation reporter RNA, the 3'UTR target site inhibits translation directed by the HCV 5'UTR. Thus, the miR-122 target sites in the 3'-region of the HCV genome are involved in a complex interplay in regulating different steps of the HCV replication cycle.},

  abstract        = {The unprecedented outbreak of Ebola in West Africa resulted in over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths, underlining the need for a better understanding of the biology of this highly pathogenic virus to develop specific counter strategies. Two filoviruses, the Ebola and Marburg viruses, result in a severe and often fatal infection in humans. However, bats are natural hosts and survive filovirus infections without obvious symptoms. The molecular basis of this striking difference in the response to filovirus infections is not well understood. We report a systematic overview of differentially expressed genes, activity motifs and pathways in human and bat cells infected with the Ebola and Marburg viruses, and we demonstrate that the replication of filoviruses is more rapid in human cells than in bat cells. We also found that the most strongly regulated genes upon filovirus infection are chemokine ligands and transcription factors. We observed a strong induction of the JAK/STAT pathway, of several genes encoding inhibitors of MAP kinases (DUSP genes) and of PPP1R15A, which is involved in ER stress-induced cell death. We used comparative transcriptomics to provide a data resource that can be used to identify cellular responses that might allow bats to survive filovirus infections.},
