  abstract        = {The annotation of small molecules in untargeted mass spectrometry relies on the matching of fragment spectra to reference library spectra. While various spectrum-spectrum match scores exist, the field lacks statistical methods for estimating the false discovery rates (FDR) of these annotations. We present empirical Bayes and target-decoy based methods to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) for 70 public metabolomics data sets. We show that the spectral matching settings need to be adjusted for each project. By adjusting the scoring parameters and thresholds, the number of annotations rose, on average, by +139% (ranging from -92 up to +5705%) when compared with a default parameter set available at GNPS. The FDR estimation methods presented will enable a user to assess the scoring criteria for large scale analysis of mass spectrometry based metabolomics data that has been essential in the advancement of proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics science.},

  abstract        = {The determination of the molecular formula is one of the earliest and most important steps when investigating the chemical nature of an unknown compound. Common approaches use the isotopic pattern of a compound measured using mass spectrometry. Computational methods to determine the molecular formula from this isotopic pattern require a fixed set of elements. Considering all possible elements severely increases running times and more importantly the chance for false positive identifications as the number of candidate formulas for a given target mass rises significantly if the constituting elements are not prefiltered. This negative effect grows stronger for compounds of higher molecular mass as the effect of a single atom on the overall isotopic pattern grows smaller. On the other hand, hand-selected restrictions on this set of elements may prevent the identification of the correct molecular formula. Thus, it is a crucial step to determine the set of elements most likely comprising the compound prior to the assignment of an elemental formula to an exact mass. In this paper, we present a method to determine the presence of certain elements (sulfur, chlorine, bromine, boron, and selenium) in the compound from its (high mass accuracy) isotopic pattern. We limit ourselves to biomolecules, in the sense of products from nature or synthetic products with potential bioactivity. The classifiers developed here predict the presence of an element with a very high sensitivity and high specificity. We evaluate classifiers on three real-world data sets with 663 isotope patterns in total: 184 isotope patterns containing sulfur, 187 containing chlorine, 14 containing bromine, one containing boron, one containing selenium. In no case do we make a false negative prediction; for chlorine, bromine, boron, and selenium, we make ten false positive predictions in total. We also demonstrate the impact of our method on the identification of molecular formulas, in particular on the number of considered candidates and running time. The element prediction will be part of the next SIRIUS release, available from https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/ .},

The SR1-encoded peptide SR1P binds GapA thereby stabilizing gapA mRNA. Under glycolytic conditions, SR1 transcription is repressed by CcpN and CcpA. A computer-based search identified 23 SR1 homologues in Bacillus, Geobacillus, Anoxybacillus and Brevibacillus species. All homologues share a high structural identity with Bacillus subtilis SR1, and the encoded SR1P peptides are highly similar. In the Bacillus cereus group, the sr1p region is present in triplicate or duplicate resulting in longer SR1 species. In all cases, sr1 expression is under control of CcpN, and transcriptional lacZ fusions of nine examined SR1 homologues were sensitive to glucose. Two homologues showed an additional glucose-independent repression by CcpN and an unknown factor. A total of 10 out of 11 tested SR1P homologues complemented a B. subtilis Δsr1 strain in their ability to stabilize gapA mRNA, but only five of them bound GapA tightly. In vitro binding assays with six SR1/ahrC pairs suggest that-despite divergent primary sequences-the base-pairing function is also preserved. In summary, SR1 is an sRNA with two functions that have been conserved over ≈1 billion years.},

We propose to use MS(n) data for the computation of fragmentation trees, and present the Colorful Subtree Closure problem to formalize this task: There, we search for a colorful subtree inside a vertex-colored graph, such that the weight of the transitive closure of the subtree is maximal. We give several negative results regarding the tractability and approximability of this and related problems. We then present an exact dynamic programming algorithm, which is parameterized by the number of colors in the graph and is swift in practice. Evaluation of our method on a dataset of 45 reference compounds showed that the quality of constructed fragmentation trees is improved by using MS(n) instead of MS² measurements.},

Fragmentation trees are constructed from EI spectra by automated signal extraction and evaluation. These trees explain relevant fragmentation reactions and assign molecular formulas to fragments. The method enables the identification of the molecular ion and the molecular formula of a metabolite if the molecular ion is present in the spectrum. These identifications are independent of existing library knowledge and, thus, support assignment and structural elucidation of unknown compounds. The method works even if the molecular ion is of very low abundance or hidden under contaminants with higher masses. We apply the algorithm to a selection of 50 derivatized and underivatized metabolites and demonstrate that in 78% of cases the molecular ion can be correctly assigned. The automatically constructed fragmentation trees correspond very well to published mechanisms and allow the assignment of specific relevant fragments and fragmentation pathways even in the most complex EI-spectra in our dataset. This method will be very helpful in the automated analysis of metabolites that are not included in common libraries and it thus has the potential to support the explorative character of metabolomics studies.},

In this paper, we focus on exact methods for the problem that are also swift in application. We first introduce data reduction techniques that allow us to infer that certain instances have no solution, or that a center string must satisfy certain conditions. We describe how to use this information to speed up two previously published search tree algorithms. Then, we describe a novel iterative search strategy that is efficient in practice, where some of our reduction techniques can also be applied. Finally, we present results of an evaluation study for two different data sets from a biological application. We find that the running time for computing the optimal center string is dominated by the subroutine calls for d = dopt -1 and d = dopt. Our data reduction is very effective for both, either rejecting unsolvable instances or solving trivial positions. We find that this speeds up computations considerably.},

Evaluation of our methods on three different datasets showed that thousands of alignments can be computed in a matter of minutes using DP, even for 'challenging' instances. Running times of the sparse DP were an order of magnitude better than for the classical DP. The ILP was clearly outperformed by both DP approaches. We also found that for both DP algorithms, computing the 1% slowest alignments required as much time as computing the 99% fastest.},
