  abstract        = {The annotation of small molecules in untargeted mass spectrometry relies on the matching of fragment spectra to reference library spectra. While various spectrum-spectrum match scores exist, the field lacks statistical methods for estimating the false discovery rates (FDR) of these annotations. We present empirical Bayes and target-decoy based methods to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) for 70 public metabolomics data sets. We show that the spectral matching settings need to be adjusted for each project. By adjusting the scoring parameters and thresholds, the number of annotations rose, on average, by +139% (ranging from -92 up to +5705%) when compared with a default parameter set available at GNPS. The FDR estimation methods presented will enable a user to assess the scoring criteria for large scale analysis of mass spectrometry based metabolomics data that has been essential in the advancement of proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics science.},

  abstract        = {The determination of the molecular formula is one of the earliest and most important steps when investigating the chemical nature of an unknown compound. Common approaches use the isotopic pattern of a compound measured using mass spectrometry. Computational methods to determine the molecular formula from this isotopic pattern require a fixed set of elements. Considering all possible elements severely increases running times and more importantly the chance for false positive identifications as the number of candidate formulas for a given target mass rises significantly if the constituting elements are not prefiltered. This negative effect grows stronger for compounds of higher molecular mass as the effect of a single atom on the overall isotopic pattern grows smaller. On the other hand, hand-selected restrictions on this set of elements may prevent the identification of the correct molecular formula. Thus, it is a crucial step to determine the set of elements most likely comprising the compound prior to the assignment of an elemental formula to an exact mass. In this paper, we present a method to determine the presence of certain elements (sulfur, chlorine, bromine, boron, and selenium) in the compound from its (high mass accuracy) isotopic pattern. We limit ourselves to biomolecules, in the sense of products from nature or synthetic products with potential bioactivity. The classifiers developed here predict the presence of an element with a very high sensitivity and high specificity. We evaluate classifiers on three real-world data sets with 663 isotope patterns in total: 184 isotope patterns containing sulfur, 187 containing chlorine, 14 containing bromine, one containing boron, one containing selenium. In no case do we make a false negative prediction; for chlorine, bromine, boron, and selenium, we make ten false positive predictions in total. We also demonstrate the impact of our method on the identification of molecular formulas, in particular on the number of considered candidates and running time. The element prediction will be part of the next SIRIUS release, available from https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/ .},

  abstract        = {SR1 is a dual-function sRNA that acts as a base-pairing regulatory RNA on the ahrC mRNA and as a peptide-encoding mRNA on the gapA operon. The SR1-encoded peptide SR1P binds GapA thereby stabilizing gapA mRNA. Under glycolytic conditions, SR1 transcription is repressed by CcpN and CcpA. A computer-based search identified 23 SR1 homologues in Bacillus, Geobacillus, Anoxybacillus and Brevibacillus species. All homologues share a high structural identity with Bacillus subtilis SR1, and the encoded SR1P peptides are highly similar. In the Bacillus cereus group, the sr1p region is present in triplicate or duplicate resulting in longer SR1 species. In all cases, sr1 expression is under control of CcpN, and transcriptional lacZ fusions of nine examined SR1 homologues were sensitive to glucose. Two homologues showed an additional glucose-independent repression by CcpN and an unknown factor. A total of 10 out of 11 tested SR1P homologues complemented a B. subtilis Δsr1 strain in their ability to stabilize gapA mRNA, but only five of them bound GapA tightly. In vitro binding assays with six SR1/ahrC pairs suggest that-despite divergent primary sequences-the base-pairing function is also preserved. In summary, SR1 is an sRNA with two functions that have been conserved over ≈1 billion years.},
